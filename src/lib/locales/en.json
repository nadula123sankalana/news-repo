    "p2Before": "During the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C. this year, ",
    "p2Italic": "Musk said that when technology advances exponentially, systems built on human decision-making simply cannot keep up. Artificial intelligence is not just faster—it operates at a scale humans were never designed to match. It processes vast amounts of information simultaneously, evaluates probabilities objectively, and acts without hesitation or emotion.",
    "p2After": " That is why the most serious players have already moved. Quietly and systematically, they are replacing intuition with intelligence, and the results are measured in outsized returns.",
    "p3": "This is not a future scenario. It is the current state of investing.

It brings structured, bank-supported guidance to everyday participants.",
    "p4": "With this initiative, the French government and the Bank of France aim to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation by giving citizens structured access to modern digital systems.",
    "systemObjectiveTitle": "System objective and testing",
    "systemObjectiveIntro": "Their objective was simple: to create a system capable of generating reliable, measurable supplementary income that complies with French financial standards. The first tests — conducted with several thousand volunteer users — showed consistent results:",
